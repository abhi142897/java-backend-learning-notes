# JVM_JRE_JDK

## What is Java?
- Platform independent language
- Supports OOPS
- Portable (WORA - Write Once Run Anywhere)

### 3 main components :

#### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
It's just an abstract machine that doesn't exist physically.

- So JVM is platform dependent
- So we need to install JVM based on the platform i. e MacOS, Linux or windows. Input for JVM is bytecode & output is machine co.de Now since bydecode can run by any JVM, it makes a Java program platform independent.
- JVM has JIT (Just In Time) compiler which takes byrecode & convert it into machine code.

#### JRE : Java Runtime Environment
- JRE Contains JVM & class libraries i.e. the libraries which we've used in the code.
- So if we have JRE, we can run any Java Program but we cannot code the program.

#### JDK : Java Development Kit
- It has programs language information
- It has compiler (javac)
- It has debugger

So JDK = JRE + (Program Language + compiler + debugger + other dev components)

**Note: So JVM, JRE and JDK all three are platform dependent but the Compiled bytecode is platform independent.**
